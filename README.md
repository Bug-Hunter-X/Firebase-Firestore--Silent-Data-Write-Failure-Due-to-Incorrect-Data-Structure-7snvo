# Firebase Firestore Silent Data Write Failure

This repository demonstrates a subtle issue in Firebase Firestore where data may fail to write correctly without throwing any errors.  The problem arises from an unexpected data structure being passed to the `set()` method, resulting in unintended nested structures instead of data updates.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

This issue highlights the importance of carefully examining the data structure you are passing to Firestore methods to avoid unexpected behavior and data inconsistencies.  Always validate your input data to prevent such silent failures.
