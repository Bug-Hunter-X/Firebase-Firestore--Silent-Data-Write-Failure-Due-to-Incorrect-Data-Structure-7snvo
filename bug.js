In a Firebase project, I encountered an unusual issue where data wasn't being written to Firestore despite seemingly correct code.  The `set()` method didn't throw any errors, but the data remained absent from the database.  Debugging revealed that the problem was caused by an incorrect data structure being passed to `set()`. I was trying to set a document field to an object with a key that already existed, but instead of updating that field, it was creating a new field within that field, leading to a nested structure rather than an update.
